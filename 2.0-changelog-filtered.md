Changelog taken from 2.0.7's changelog.txt (which can also be viewed [online](https://forums.factorio.com/116184)).

Split into "Modding", which covers [prototype stage](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/auxiliary/data-lifecycle.html#prototype-stage) changes, and "Scripting", which covers [runtime stage](https://lua-api.factorio.com/latest/auxiliary/data-lifecycle.html#save-startup) changes.

I've removed many lines listing "added" features, which aren't relevant for _porting_ mods specifically.
I've also expanded some entries to make Control+F easier.
